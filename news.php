            <h2>Make a difference by participating in three-day charity event</h2>
            <p>
                KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysians can get into the festive mood of sharing and caring by taking part in the BeWithYou Community Caring Campaign at Wisma MCA here until Wednesday (Dec 6).Organised through a collaboration between the Crisis Relief Squad of MCA (CRSM) and GoCare, the three-day campaign gives people the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of the less fortunate by taking part in a range of charitable activities. Held in conjunction with International Volunteer Day, the activity's highlight will be the “Toy Story” campaign that will allow volunteers to repackage toys into their own self-painted gift boxes. These gift boxes will then be delivered to disadvantaged and Orang Asli communities across the country. This activity is designed to provide volunteers the ability to express their efforts through their own personal creative touch. “These unique creations promise to bring about an extra special sense of joy and warmth to children during the holiday season,” said CRSM secretary-general Ng Sing Phing at the event's launch ceremony on Tuesday (Dec 5). The campaign, which began yesterday (Dec 4), also features monsoon flood charity crowdfunding, charity bazaars, charity food trucks and many other collaborative efforts with various groups. “We hope to inspire increased compassion and solidarity among the people while fostering a more inclusive and caring society of like-minded individuals who work together to help vulnerable groups through difficult times,” she added. To this, Ng highlighted the important role that the government and businesses can play in helping the needy. “The government must pay close attention and be prepared to extend additional assistance to low-income groups when necessary. “The business community on the other hand should intensify its embrace of corporate social responsibility by cultivating a robust volunteer culture among its employees while actively contributing to creation of job opportunities for the underprivileged,” she said. Also attending the launch was Johor health and unity committee chairman Ling Tian Soon who extended his support for the event. “This event will serve as a powerful catalyst in capturing the attention of people from various diverse backgrounds and directing them towards the needs of the vulnerable. “This will help foster a sense of warmth and care within the community and inspire many others to join the ranks of volunteers,” he said at the event. Those interested in participating in the campaign can check out the activities in the lobby area of Wisma MCA here until tomorrow (Dec 6) or check out other ways to help through www.gocare.org.my. Meanwhile, those eager to volunteer for future efforts can contact CRSM through 03-2203 3979 or contact the CRSM Facebook page for more information.

            <h2>Charity begins at home</h2>
            <p>KARL ISKANDAR Ahmad Bakri, 15, began helping the less fortunate when he was only nine. His mother, Noorianti Zainol Abidin, 50, not only taught him the value of sharing, she also assisted him in pooling resources to help those in need. He had realized from a young age that some people did not have enough money to buy food to sustain themselves. “My mother was always finding ways to help other people beyond just giving occasionally. “She wanted our project to be more structured and reach a larger number of people,” said Karl Iskandar, an only child and a student of SM Islam IQKL. Noorianti said their initiative called “Projek Kongsi Pahala Kasihnyakarl” began in October 2017. Since then, the duo who live in Shah Alam, have helped more than 1,000 individuals. “I wanted to teach him the value of giving instead of piling up wealth and material items for ourselves. “I told him that instead of buying more toys, he could use the money to help others who don't have enough to put food on the table,” said the businesswoman who used to work in the corporate sector.</p>

            <h2>Doing his bit by selling RM1 nasi lemak for charity</h2>
            <p>JOHOR BARU: Muhammad Alif Ikhfan Abdullah (pic below) is a hardworking young man who does several jobs and still has time to sell nasi lemak for charity.

                Since 2021, Muhammad Alif, 28, and his 67-year-old grandmother, Maimunah Ahmad, have been selling and delivering RM1 nasi lemak to those who are donating to charity homes and mosques.“After completing my degree in Physics in 2018, I have been doing some part-time jobs so that I could have time to take care of my grandmother and great-grandmother.

                “However, when Covid-19 hit in March 2020, I could no longer take up any part-time jobs and needed to find a way to get income. That was when my grandmother and I thought of starting the RM1 nasi lemak business from home.
                
                “My grandmother makes the nasi lemak while I deliver them to our customers. We did this for about one year before deciding to focus on selling the nasi lemak for charity,” he said in an interview.
                
                Muhammad Alif, who works as an administrative and customer service officer as well as a part-time tutor, said that they decided to do so as they noticed that they have many customers who were buying the nasi lemak to be donated to charity homes instead of consuming it themselves.
                
                “During the peak of Covid-19, we could really see Malaysians banding together to help one another and that inspired us to provide this service.“In the past, we sold nasi lemak to everyone and charged a delivery fee of between RM1 and RM2, depending on the location.

                “However, since April 2021, we started to focus on selling the nasi lemak to individuals who want to donate the food to charity and not charge them any delivery fee,” he said.
                
                Muhammad Alif said that he delivers the nasi lemak once a week.
                
                “In the past, we would make and deliver the nasi lemak almost every day, but since I am now juggling two jobs, I could only do so once a week. However, during the month of Ramadan, I will do so every day as there is a lot of demand from customers who want to do charity,” he said.
                
                Muhammad Alif said that he also has customers who would leave it entirely up to him to decide on which charity homes to donate to.
                
                “I have customers who will book dozens of nasi lemak and tell me to just donate to any charity home I know,” he said. “Some will already have the homes they want to donate to and have me deliver it to them.”
                
                “After making the delivery, I will send them a short report and some photos,” he said. He added that he hopes to inspire others to also find their own unique way to contribute to the community.
                
                “I may not have the money to donate to those in need, but what I can do is to donate my energy and provide a platform to others who want to help.
                
                “I hope that in the future, I can expand this initiative further.
                
                “My plan is to reach out to single-mother associations and train their members to earn a living through this business while doing their bit for charity,” he said.</p>
